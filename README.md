#*PROJECT OVERVIEW*:

This project is a File Integrity Monitoring System designed to track changes in a specific directory by generating and storing file hashes. It consists of a Python-based backend using Flask and a React frontend for visualization. The backend continuously scans the directory and detects file changes by comparing their SHA-256 hashes against previously stored values in a JSON file. It identifies new, modified, and deleted files and provides real-time logs through a REST API.

The frontend fetches logs from the Flask server at regular intervals and displays them in an easy-to-understand interface, making it simple to monitor file modifications. Flask-CORS is used to handle cross-origin requests, ensuring smooth interaction between the backend and frontend. The system is optimized for both development and production environments, with Waitress available as a production-ready WSGI server.

This tool is essential for maintaining data integrity, detecting unauthorized changes, and enhancing security. By combining Flask and React, it offers an efficient, user-friendly experience for real-time file monitoring.
